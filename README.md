<h1>Hangman Game</h1>
<p>Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to identify a secret word. The game starts by displaying a series of blank spaces that represent the letters in the secret word, and the player has to guess the letters one at a time. If the player correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank space is replaced by the letter. If the player guesses incorrectly, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or the hanging man is completely drawn.</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This Hangman game project is implemented in Java and uses file I/O to read a list of words from a file. The game randomly chooses a word from the list and then challenges the player to guess the word one letter at a time. The player has 10 attempts to guess the word, and if they fail to guess the word within that limit, they lose the game.</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<p>The Hangman project consists of a single Java file named "Hangman.java". The file contains the main method and two other methods. The main method initializes the game by reading the list of words from the file, selecting a random word from the list, and initializing the hidden word with underscores. The main method then calls the <b>playerGuess</b> method, which is responsible for prompting the player to guess a letter and updating the hidden word accordingly. The <b>playerGuess</b> method also calls the <b>isGameOver</b> method to check if the game is over.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>This implementation of Hangman is a basic version of the game. Here are some ways in which it can be improved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the player to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which can determine the length of the word and the number of guesses.</li>
  <li>Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's performance across multiple games.</li>
  <li>Add the ability for the player to save and load their progress in the game.</li>
  <li>Implement a multiplayer mode where two or more players can compete against each other.</li>
</ul>
